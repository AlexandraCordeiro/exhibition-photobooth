# exhibition-photobooth

## Goal
A digital photobooth developed in Processing as part of a Multimedia Design Workshop project.

The aim of the project is to create an exhibition about the designer Teresa Sdralevich, from the graphic identity to the interactive and technological components of the exhibition.

This photobooth serves the purpose of offering a souvenir of the exhibition in the form of a receipt.
